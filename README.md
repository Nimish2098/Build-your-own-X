# 🛠️ Build Your Own X — 30-Day Challenge

Welcome to my **Build Your Own X** challenge!

For the next **30 days**, I will build one project each day from scratch, inspired by the [Build Your Own X](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro/)] movement. This challenge is aimed at deepening my understanding of core computer science concepts by building foundational systems, tools, and utilities myself — no shortcuts, no libraries that do all the work.

## 🎯 Goals

- Reinforce low-level programming fundamentals
- Understand how popular tools and systems work under the hood
- Practice clean, readable, and testable code
- Explore multiple programming languages and paradigms
- Share progress regularly on GitHub and LinkedIn

## 🔄 Daily Workflow

1. Pick a topic/tool/system to clone
2. Research how it works (but avoid copying code)
3. Plan basic structure
4. Code from scratch
5. Write a simple README for the day’s project
6. Push to this repo with a meaningful commit
7. Share a post on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)
